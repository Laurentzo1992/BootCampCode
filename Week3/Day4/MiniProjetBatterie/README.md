# drumset_setup

## Project Brief

Create a drumset using HTML, CSS, JS.

1. Focus on the JS. Get it working. Make it look pretty later.

2. Look up how to play audio in html and js. (w3schools)

3. Add event listeners for keyboard and/or mouse clicks.
    - for keyboard events, you can get the key by looking at the "event" object's keyCode.

    - for mouse click events, you can get the key by looking at the "this" object.

4. The repo contains a folder with soundfiles.


 This looks complex, but its pretty simple.

 - Get the clicked element, or key press.
 - Use it's value to get the correct audio element.
 - Play the audio element.

 Have fun, good luck!
